# What's a spanning tree? a tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. 
    A spanning tree has all vertices of its original graph.

# What's the minimal number of edges in a connected graph?

# A minimum spanning tree always has all N vertices (nodes) and N-1 edges.

# What's Kruskal's algorithm? a greedy algo to find the minimal spanning tree of a graph (MST).
    1. you start with removing parallel edges that have higher weights and loops.
    2. now that you have only one edge between two vertices, 
        write all edges, from lowest weight to highest weight.
    3. draw all vertices.
    4. starting from lowest weight, add edges from the list.
    5. there shouldn't be more than one way to get from one 
        node to another, cycles are not allowed.
